# Automated-Warehouse-Inventory-Management-System
Here we have simulated an optimised inventory management System using Robot Operating System. 

The arena is an automated warehouse setting where essential packages are required to be sent out to different cities or different parts of a city. Since Industry 4.0 heavily focuses on automation here the warehouse only consists of two industrial robotics arms which are going to be used. As the requirements are sent to the warehouse, one robotic arm will identify the packages from a shelf and place them on a conveyor belt and the other robotic arm at the end of the conveyor belt will pick these objects from the conveyor and place them into the bins. Each bin represents a priority level, red bin for “High Priority (HP)”, yellow bin for “Medium Priority (MP)” & green bin for “Low Priority (LP)”. As the packages are sent out from the warehouse there will also be alerts sent to the user via email notifying them about the package being dispatched & shipped from the warehouse. The packages to be delivered have their own priorities. Packages having a higher priority are intended for a natural disaster or a pandemic situation. Other packages with lower priorities are for general purposes. Similar to a conductor in an orchestra, we have designed our own conductor for the warehouse to make smart decisions in order to deliver high priority packages as quickly as possible.
