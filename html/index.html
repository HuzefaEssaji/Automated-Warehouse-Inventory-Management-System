<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Our Theme is “Vargi Bots”. Inspired by the visualisation of Industry 4.0, Vargi is taken from a Sanskrit word, Vargikaran (वर्गीकरण) which means to separate objects based on their category.
The arena is an automated warehouse setting where essential packages are required to be sent out to different cities or different parts of a city. Since Industry 4.0 heavily focuses on automation here the warehouse only consists of two industrial robotics arms which are going to be used. As the requirements are sent to the warehouse, one robotic arm will identify the packages from a shelf and place them on a conveyor belt and the other robotic arm at the end of the conveyor belt will pick these objects from the conveyor and place them into the bins. Each bin represents a priority level, red bin for “High Priority (HP)”, yellow bin for “Medium Priority (MP)” &amp; green bin for “Low Priority (LP)”. As the packages are sent out from the warehouse there will also be alerts sent to the user via email notifying them about the package being dispatched &amp; shipped from the warehouse. The packages to be delivered have their own priorities. Packages having a higher priority are intended for a natural disaster or a pandemic situation. Other packages with lower priorities are for general purposes. Similar to a conductor in an orchestra, we have designed our own conductor for the warehouse to make smart decisions in order to deliver high priority packages as quickly as possible.</p>

<dt><strong>Topics used</strong>:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li><strong>/eyrc/vb/camera_1/image_raw</strong> = This is the topic on which the image taken by 2D camera in the warehouse will be published as image stream. The Image stream received by this topics’ subscription will be converted into an image using CV2 module and after doing image processing the QR codes in the images will be decoded to get information about each of the 12 packages on the shelf in warehouse.(refer camera_class module)</li>
<li><strong>/eyrc/vb/logical_camera_2</strong> = This topic is used to get the model names that are under logical_camera_2 to stop the conveyor as soon as the package reaches below it so the ur52 can pick the package and place into its proper bin. This functioning is made possible in the function callback of this topics’ subscription in class Ur52 class present in the ur5_classes module.</li>
<li><strong>/2437/incomingorders/</strong> = (Custom topic) : This topic is used to communicate internally with the nodes to get the incoming orders which is received by action server after the incoming order is being published on the MQTT topic <strong>/eyrc/vb/JjAaHhBb/orders</strong> . The action server will publish the order received on this topic so that other nodes can access this orders’ information</li>

<dt><strong>Services used</strong>:</dt>

<dt><strong>Data structure and Sorting algorithm used for sorting the packages</strong>:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>The concept of priority queues is used to store and sort the packages based on their priority.</li>

<dt>Three priority queues are used :</dt>

</li>
<li>The <em>get_order()</em> function will do all the task related to sorting and giving the order of highest priority present at that instance to ur51. First the ORDER_HP list will be checked, if orders is present in the list (queue) then it will pop the order at index 0 and return that order. Else if the list is empty it will check inside ORDER_MP list and in the same manner the ORDER_LP list will be checked. If all the lists are empty it will repeatedly check for each list until an order is received.</li>

<li>This node will first subscribe to the topic /eyrc/vb/camera_1/image_raw to get the image stream. A new of object of class Camera1 (c_1) is created to handle the task of image processing. Once the image is received it will be cropped into 12 parts , each part having one packages’ QR code. After cleaning the image (adding contrast and reducing noise in the image) the QR code will be decoded. On the basis of the result(color) the priority will be assigned and the package will be appended into the colors dictionary (The colors dictionary is having the key as the package name and value as its item type.) At the same time the data regarding each decoded package will be sent to the inventory spreadsheet as a goal to action server via action_client.</li>
<li>This node has also subscribed to the topic /2437/incomingoreders/ (custom topic). As the message regarding the package is being published on this topic the function callback of this subscription will append the order according to its priority in its respective list (queue).</li>

Once the package name is found , its row number and column number is extracted and that package is removed from the colors dictionary. Row, Column number and updated colors dictionary is returned.</li>
<li>The waypoints list is containing the number of saved trajectories for the package at its indexes. The gripper list is containing the number of the saved trajectory after which the gripper is to be activated when executing the saved trajectories for a particular package.</li>
<li>After getting the row and column no. of required package, its saved trajectories are executed and once the ur51 places order on the conveyor it will send goal to action server to send data to spreadsheet “DispatchedOrders” and “Dashboard”. At the same time DISPATCHED_ORDER list will be appended by this order.</li>
<li>But before placing the order on the conveyor, ur51 will check the CONVEYOR_FLAG status which means if the any previous package that is currently present on the conveyor is being picked by ur52 or not. If not, then it will wait for ur52 to pick that package and then it will place this package on conveyor and then start the conveyor. If previous package is not present on the conveyor, then it will simply place the package and start the conveyor.</li>

<li>On the basis of the order present at the 0th index of the DISPATCHED_ORDER list, it will be popped out and stored in variable current_order. The current_order priority will decide the bin color and ur52 will set its angle to go to that particular bin.</li>
